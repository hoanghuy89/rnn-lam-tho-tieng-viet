# Language modeling with RNN and transformer on vietnamese data
I made a crawler to download all data on download.vn and compile it into single txt file. The data is for research purpose and not to be distributed.

With that data in hands, we can generate literature in hilarious elementary and high school style. We start with simple RNN with attention many to one, then to LSTM, and finally transformer architecture. Using only characters as vocabulary and to generate one character at a time.
